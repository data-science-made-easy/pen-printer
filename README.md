# Build a cheap pen-printer with R

# Buy

1. Raspberry Pi (RPi)
2. PCA9685 controller with three SG90 servos
3. 5V power supply for both RPi (2A) and PCA9685 (1A)
4. Popsicle sticks
5. Glue
6. Clip
7. Pen

Ad 1. I have `cat /proc/device-tree/model` Raspberry Pi Model B Plus Rev 1.2 with 'Linux rpi 5.4.51+ #1333' as operating system.

## Prerequisites
On your PC or Mac install R and required libraries. You can go through the code to find out which libraries you need to install. Alternatively, you can just run the code and find out by trial and error.

On your RPi install:

- R; I have R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- "Eggshell Igloo"
- [pca9685servodaemon](https://github.com/data-science-made-easy/pca9685servodaemon) in the same folder as this repository; kudos to [Tim Rowledge](https://github.com/timrowledge)

Download this repository to both PC and RPi.

### Hardware
Fix (glue) the first servo on two popsicle sticks (top one sticking over the paper) to *e.g.* some wooden plate. Connect the other servos to the first one as in the figure. First try them out following the code below to get the angles right :-) Then connect the servos to the PCA9685 controller and connect the controller to your RPi:

1. [Step 1](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi)
2. [Step 2](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi/configuring-your-pi-for-i2c)
3. [Step 3](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi/hooking-it-up)

The image shows the popsicle sticks below the first servo are under an angle of `base_angle` = 60Â° = pi / 3 (small angle with paper). After some simulations, this angle seems optimal to me.

## Start R on your PC
Run `pc-plot-girl.R`. This will

- load constants
  - please take a look and update the constants where needed. *E.g.*, the servos are now on channels (s0, first arm) 13, (s1, second arm) 14 and (s2, head with pen) 15; please update these values if you put the servos on different channels on the pca controller
- load calibration details of your servos
  - for the most accurate results, you should calibrate your servos by hand and update `servo-calibration.R` accordingly
- determine the positions within reach of the pen
- load `img/girl.jpg` and convert to lines using an edge detection library
- maximally upscale these lines to just fit within reachable area
- plot a4 with reachable area (green) and lines
- save lines as `tasks.RData`

Now scp `tasks.RData` to this repositories folder on your RPi.

The tasks data.frame looks like this:

The tasks data.frame consists of interpollated short lines that describe the major lines resulting from the edge detection. First two columsn (`x`, `y`) are the coordinates (mm), followed by angles of arms (rad) and corresponding pulsewidth of first two servos. `pen_down` indicates whether the short line should be plotted. `error` is a pre-calculated deviation from a straight line between start point and begin point of major line. In practice, this error will larger due to the imprecision of the cheap SG90 servos. Better servos will certainly result in a more accurate drawing.

## Start R on your RPi
... in the folder of this repository. `source("pi-plot-girl.R")` should plot the image that is shown above.

Have fun!
